        <p>This is my #miku100 journey! From June 23 to October 20, 2021 I drew virtual singing sensation Hatsune Miku once a day, almost every day, 100 times over (technically more if you wanna count the animations *sweat*). The challenge was originally
            created by TopDylan (@ToppiestDylan) with rules that seemed simple enough to follow: no stacking up, and to take breaks as needed. Having graduated during the pandemic, I was feeling burnt out, uninspired, and frankly unsure of when I would
            feel like picking up my tablet pen again. Yet when I came across the miku100 challenge it occurred to me that I could still steal some parts of the day to indulge in something I thought I might enjoy. So, I took on the feat of drawing a character
            that embodied both a lot of nostalgia and charm for me. Over, and over again.

        <p>Are they all perfect? Nope! Some days I was feeling more ambitious than others, but I'd like to consider this less like a formal art series and more like a sketchbook that I invite you all to see! My goal was to keep things fun and use the opportunity
            to try new things here and there.</p>
        <p>At some point near the end of miku100, I realized I had all these Mikus but no easy way to show them. Social media feeds can be tedious to look through sometimes, and after a certain point Twitter could not handle my long thread of Miku doodles.
            Having a place that I could easily point to and say "Hey! Want to know about that time I drew Hatsune Miku a bunch of times?" seemed like the next logical step for me. I turned that problem into an excuse to learn some javascript and made
            this website entirely from scratch. It has a few hiccups (especially for mobile users, if you managed to make it this far) but I hope to improve it as I go. Thanks for stopping by! </p>
