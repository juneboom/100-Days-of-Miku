        <h1 class="page-title">So uh, June... What is this?</h1>
        <p>This is my #miku100 journey! From June 23 to October 20, 2021 I drew virtual singing sensation Hatsune Miku once a day, almost everyday, 100 times over (technically more if you wanna count the animations *sweat*). This challenge originated from
            Twitter by TopDylan (@ToppiestDylan) with rules that seemed simple enough to follow: no stacking up, and to take breaks as needed. Having graduated from the class of doomer times, I was feeling burnt out, uninspired, and frankly unsure of
            when the next time I would pick up my tablet pen would come. So I took on the feat of drawing a character both familiar and charming to me. Over, and over again.

        <p>Are they all perfect? Nope! Some days I was feeling more ambitious than others, but I'd like to consider this less like a series and more like a digital sketchbook that I invite you all to see! My goal was to keep things fun and use the opportunity
            to try new things here and there.</p>
        <p>I learned in more ways than one: social media feeds can sometimes be tedious to look through, and after a certain point Twitter could not handle my long thread of miku doodles. Having a place that I could easily point to and say "Hey! Want to
            know about that time I drew Hatsune Miku a bunch of times?" seemed like the next logical step for me. I made this website entirely from scratch, and dabbled with a little bit (ok, maybe a medium bit) of javascript to present to you what you
            see now. </p>
